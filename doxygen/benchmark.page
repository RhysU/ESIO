/*! \page benchmark Benchmarking

ESIO provides an MPI-based benchmarking utility named \c esio_bench.

\c esio_bench is built and installed alongside the library.  It can simulate
various combinations of writing fields, planes, and lines to disk to simplify
measuring ESIO's weak- and strong-scaling write throughput on your favorite
system.  When ESIO is configured to use GRVY (see \subpage installation), \c
esio_bench provides much more detailed performance information.  See
<tt>esio_bench --help</tt> for more details.
