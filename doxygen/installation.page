/*! \page installation Installation

ESIO uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool) for its
development build system.  This system is popular among the Linux development
community and provides a familiar build environment for end users.

To build ESIO starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

\code
 > tar xvfz esio-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd esio-$(VERSION)/
\endcode

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>GNU Make</dt>
  <dd>You must have <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU
      Make</a> installed as ESIO's build system relies on many GNU
      extensions.
  </dd>
  <dt>Compilers</dt>
  <dd>You must have a working C and Fortran 90 compiler from the
      same vendor.  Currently the GNU (<tt>gcc</tt>/<tt>gfortran</tt>)
      and Intel (<tt>icc</tt>/<tt>ifort</tt>) compilers are supported. If
      ESIO's configure script cannot automatically detect the correct
      compiler location, try setting \$CC and \$FC environment
      variables prior to running configure.
  </dd>
  <dt>MPI</dt>
  <dd>You must have a working Message Passing Interface (MPI)
      implementation.  If ESIO's configure script cannot automatically
      detect your MPI installation, try setting the \$MPICC and \$MPIFC
      environment variables prior to running configure.
  </dd>
  <dt>HDF5</dt>
  <dd>You must have a working <a
      href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a>
      installation compiled with MPI parallel support (see HDF5
      configure's <code>--enable-parallel</code> option for details).
      HDF5 Fortran support  is <i>not</i>required.  The same MPI stack and
      Fortran compiler used to compile HDF5 must be used to build ESIO.
      ESIO's configure script should detect the appropriate information
      if HDF5's <code>h5pcc</code> compiler wrapper is in your path.
      If your HDF5 installation is not detected correctly, you may use
      ESIO's <code>--with-hdf5</code> option to specify a location.
  </dd>
  <dt>GRVY (optional)</dt>
  <dd>ESIO can optionally use The Groovy Toolkit (GRVY) if it is
      detected at configure time.  If your GRVY installation is not
      detected correctly, you may use ESIO's <code>--with-grvy</code>
      option to specify a location.
  </dd>
</dl>

To configure ESIO, within the esio-$(VERSION) directory issue
\code
 > ./configure
\endcode
where you should add any additional configure options at the end of
the command.  One very useful option is the <code>--prefix=DIR</code>
which sets your desired top-level installation directory for ESIO.

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful,
this will build the ESIO library (static and dynamic versions), several
examples, and some additional ESIO-related utilities.

\code > make \endcode

<h2> Build Verification (Optional) </h2>

To optionally verify that the software is working properly, a check target is
provided to run a suite of functionality tests against the local build.  To run
these tests, issue

\code > make check \endcode

Many of the tests require your MPI installation's <code>mpiexec</code>
command to be usable.  Such tests may not be executable on many public
high performance computing platform login nodes.

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue

\code > make install \endcode

to install the library.  The installation will consist of three top-level
directories housing ESIO's include files, compiled libraries, and utilities.
