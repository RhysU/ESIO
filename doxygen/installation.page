/*! \page installation Installation

ESIO uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool)
for its development build system.  This system is popular among the
Linux development community and provides a familiar build environment
for end users.

To build ESIO starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution
and enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz esio-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd esio-$(VERSION)/            
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

<b>HDF5 dependency</b>: ESIO requires that the <a
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library be
available locally.  HDF5 must have been configured with both
Fortran and MPI parallel support (<code>--enable-fortran</code> and
<code>--enable-parallel</code>, respectively).  The same MPI stack and
Fortran compiler used to compile HDF5 should be used to build ESIO.

ESIO's configuration script should detect the appropriate information
if HDF5's <code>h5pcc</code> compiler wrapper is in your path.
If your HDF5 installation is not detected correctly, you may use ESIO's
<code>--with-hdf5</code> option to specify a location.

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to
specify your desired top-level installation directory for ESIO.

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If
successful, this will build the ESIO library (static and dynamic versions)
and several examples.

\code > make \endcode

<b>Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working properly, a
test option is provided to run a short suite of functionality tests against the
local build.  To run, issue a <tt>make check</tt> to run the tests.  Many of
the tests require your MPI installation's <code>mpiexec</code> command to be
available.

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue a <tt>make install</tt> to install
the library.  The installation will consist of two top-level
directories housing the library and include files.
