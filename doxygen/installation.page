/*! \page installation Installation

ESIO uses the GNU autotools suite (autoconf, automake, and libtool) for its
development build system.  This system is popular among the Linux development
community and provides a familiar build environment for end users.

To build ESIO starting from a release distribution, untar the distribution and
enter the top-level directory.

<div class="fragment"><pre class="fragment">
 > tar xvfz esio-$(VERSION).tar.gz
 > cd esio-$(VERSION)/
</pre></div>

<h2>Configuration Requirements</h2>

<b>HDF5 dependency</b>: ESIO requires that the <a
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> library be available locally.
HDF5 must have been configured with both Fortran and MPI parallel support
(<code>--enable-fortran</code> and <code>--enable-parallel</code>,
respectively).  The same MPI stack and Fortran compiler used to compile HDF5
should be used to build ESIO.

ESIO's configuration script should detect the appropriate information if HDF5's
<code>h5pcc</code> compiler wrapper is in your path.  If your HDF5 installation
is not detected correctly, you may use ESIO's <code>--with-hdf5</code> option
to specify a location.

ESIO can optionally use The Groovy Toolkit (GRVY) if it is detected at
configure time.  If your GRVY installation is not detected correctly, you may
use ESIO's <code>--with-grvy</code> option to specify a location.

<b>Installation Directory</b>: Use the <tt>--prefix</tt> option to specify your
desired top-level installation directory for ESIO.

<h2> Library Build </h2>

Once configured, issue a <tt>make</tt> to build the software. If successful,
this will build the ESIO library (static and dynamic versions), several
examples, and some additional ESIO-related utilities.

\code > make \endcode

<b>Verifying the build:</b> To verify that the software is working properly, a
test option is provided to run a suite of functionality tests against the local
build.  To run these tests, issue <tt>make check</tt>.  Many of the tests
require your MPI installation's <code>mpiexec</code> command to be usable and
may not be usable on many public high performance computing platform login
nodes.

<h2> Installation </h2>

After the build is complete, issue

\code > make install \endcode

to install the library.  The installation will consist of three top-level
directories housing ESIO's include files, compiled libraries, and utilities.
