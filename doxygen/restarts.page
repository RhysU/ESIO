/*! \page restarts Writing restart files

ESIO provides several methods that greatly simplify writing a sequence of
metadata-rich restart files.  Each restart file might contain a simulation
snapshot at a particular time along with enough information to track how the
data was generated and to allow data post-processing.

A complete, C-based MPI program using ESIO to write a (trivial) sequence
of restart files might look like:
\includelineno restart1.c
Analogous method calls exist in the ESIO Fortran API.

This sample prepares a copy of loop-invariant data in the file "template.h5".
Often this would include the program version, scenario parameters, and grid
information.  Then, when the code needs to write a new restart file during the
simulation loop, a new uncommitted restart file called "uncommitted.h5" is
cloned from "template.h5" using esio_file_clone().  After the program has
successfully written all the necessary data to the restart file, the restart
file is committed using esio_file_close_restart().

The documentation for the esio_file_close_restart() method contains several
important details.  The same functionality is also available in Fortran via the
methods esio::esio_file_clone() and esio::esio_file_close_restart().

Using such an approach provides several benefits:
<ol>
<li>Common metadata is written only once.  In a long-running simulation,
    this may provide some performance benefits compared to repeatedly
    writing the same metadata within the simulation loop.</li>
<li>Incomplete restart data is kept separate from complete restart
    data.  This prevents a software or hardware failure from destroying
    your simulation's last known good state.</li>
<li>A history of restart data is maintained.  This is useful when
    simulation statistics must be gathered across multiple snapshots.</li>
</ol>

ESIO also provides a standalone, non-HDF5 utility named \c esio_restart which
can be used to test ESIO's restart file management capabilities.  See
<tt>esio_rename --help</tt> for more details.
