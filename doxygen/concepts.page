This page first covers a \ref conceptsusage "sample ESIO use case"
and then provides an introduction to and details about these ESIO
concepts:

\section conceptsusage Sample usage

ESIO usage usually involves some variation on the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>Initialize an opaque \ref esio_handle for a
      particular MPI communicator.</li>
  <li>Create or open a data file using the handle.</li>
  <li>Write or read some attributes using the handle.</li>
  <li>Write or read one or more distributed lines, planes, or fields
      of data using the handle.</li>
  <li>Close the data file using the handle.</li>
  <li>Finalize the \c esio_handle.</li>
</ol>

A complete C-based MPI program using ESIO to write some (trivial) data
might look like:
\include concepts1.c

\section conceptshandles Handles

ESIO maintains state within opaque \ref esio_handle "esio_handles".
A user creates an \c esio_handle by invoking esio_handle_initialize() with
an MPI communicator.  All subsequent calls to the ESIO API using that
particular handle <i>must be made collectively</i> across the MPI
communicator supplied at the handle's creation time.  When finished
using a handle, a user calls esio_handle_finalize().

Multiple \c esio_handle may be created against the same or different MPI
communicators.  For example, one handle may created against MPI_COMM_WORLD
and another created against MPI_COMM_SELF.  ESIO calls using the first
handle must be made collectively across all MPI ranks.  In contrast,
ESIO calls using the second handle may be made on only a single rank
(that is, collectively across MPI_COMM_SELF).

To the extent allowed by the underlying MPI stack and the parallel HDF5
implementation, ESIO is thread safe provided that a single \c esio_handle
is not used concurrently by more than one thread.

\section conceptsfiles Files

ESIO data files are, for all intents and purposes, simply <a
href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">HDF5</a> files usable by any
application conforming to the <a href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/">The
HDF5 Group</a>'s specifications.

At any time, a \ref esio_handle may have a data file associated with it.
A file must be associated with a handle before any attributes or data may
be read or written.  Existing files may be opened using esio_file_open().
New files may be created using esio_file_create().  When finished using
a file, a user should call esio_file_close().

Information written to a file is <i>always</i> buffered and should
<i>not</i> be assumed to be on disk while a file is open.  Buffers are
flushed when a file is closed.  Buffers may explicitly be flushed using
esio_file_flush().

\section conceptsattributes Attributes

ESIO can read or write either numeric or string attributes.
Attribute access must be done using contiguous memory and each MPI
rank must write or read the same data.  Attributes are often useful for
tracking simulation global metadata.  Examples include a program version
identifier, a Reynolds number, or an array containing collocation point
values needed on every MPI rank.

Signed integers, single-, and double-precision floating
point scalar-valued attributes are supported via methods like
esio_attribute_write_double() and esio_attribute_read_double().
Vector-valued attributes are manipulated using methods like
esio_attribute_writev_double() and esio_attribute_readv_double().
When reading a numeric attribute, the user is responsible for having
allocated a buffer sufficiently large to hold the information.  The user
may query the number of components in existing vector-valued data using
esio_attribute_sizev().  Notice that methods handling vector-valued
numeric data uniformly contain a <i>v</i>.

Arbitrary length strings can be written and read using
esio_string_set() and esio_string_get().  Note that, unlike
numeric attribute's read methods, esio_string_get() allocates space
for variable length data.  It is the user's responsibility to
\c free the storage allocated by esio_string_get().

\section conceptslines Lines

ESIO can read or write distributed one-dimensional, numeric data
(termed "lines").  Though reading or writing a numeric field must be done
collectively, different ranks can (and often do) manipulate disjoint
data within a line.  In addition to a type and a memory buffer, when
manipulating a line each MPI rank must supply
<ol>
<li>the global number of data elements within the line
    (\c aglobal), </li>
<li>the global starting offset to be handled by this rank
    (\c astart),</li>
<li>the number of data elements to be handled by this rank
    (\c alocal), and </li>
<li>the stride to use between adjacent data elements
    <i>in the local memory buffer</i> (\c astride).</li>
</ol>

Global offsets start at zero within the C API.  Strides, which must be
nonnegative, are specified in terms of the scalar size.  For example,
when writing \c double precision data strides are expressed in
units of <tt>sizeof(double)</tt>.  Specifying a zero \c astride
is equivalent to specifying that the data is stored contiguously
in memory.  Data is <i>always</i> stored contiguously in the file.
Example methods for scalar-valued lines are esio_line_write_float()
and esio_line_read_float().  Information about the size of a line within
a data file may be obtained using esio_line_size().

Vector-valued lines may also be utilized.  These may be useful
for storing complex numbers (as a two-component vector) or other
"interleaved" data.  Vector components must be adjacent in memory.
Example methods for vector-valued lines are esio_line_writev_float() and
esio_line_readv_float().  Information about the size of a line within
a data file, including the number of vector components it contains,
may be obtained using esio_line_sizev().

Strides between vector-valued line data are expressed in terms of the size
of a single component.  For example, strides for a five-component vector
in double precision are expressed in terms of <tt>sizeof(double)</tt>.
This allows the same \c astride value provided to ESIO to be used in other
pointer arithmetic contexts.  Unfortunately, due to a limitation in HDF5,
\c astride must be an even multiple of the number of components in use.

\section conceptsplanes Planes

ESIO can read or write distributed two-dimensional, numeric data (termed
"planes").  Such operations can be thought of as a tensor product of
two \ref conceptslines "line" operations in all senses.  In addition to
a line's \c aglobal, \c astart, etc., a plane contains \c bglobal, \c
bstart, etc.  The "A" direction is the faster index in files and appears
after the "B" direction in all C API calls.  Typically the "A" direction
should be the faster direction in memory as well.  Existing plane data
may be queried using esio_plane_size() or esio_plane_sizev().

\section conceptsfields Fields

ESIO can read or write distributed three-dimensional, numeric
data (termed "fields").  Field methods add \c cglobal, \c cstart,
etc. arguments beyond those found for a \ref conceptsplanes "plane".
The "A" direction is the fastest index in files and appears rightmost
in all C API calls.  Typically the "A" direction should be the
fastest direction in memory as well.  Sample field routines are
esio_field_write_int(), esio_field_read_int(), esio_field_writev_int(),
and esio_field_readv_int().  Existing field data may be queried using
esio_field_size() or esio_field_sizev().

\section conceptslayouts Layouts

To provide flexibility and aid IO performance tuning for particular
HPC platforms, \ref conceptsfields "fields" may be laid out in HDF5
files in different manners (termed "layouts").  Fields are stored with
sufficient metadata for ESIO to be able to determine which layout was
used to write data to file.  Further, operations on any existing field
will always use the layout with which a field was initially created.

The total number of field layouts available may be queried using
esio_layout_count().  The default layout associated with a particular
\ref esio_handle can be retrieved using esio_layout_get() and specified
using esio_layout_set().  The default layout is used whenever esio writes
a new field to file.  Note that any existing layout is preserved when
a field is overwritten.

Two layouts are available in the current ESIO release.  The first
(and default) layout 0 provides maximum interoperability with other
HDF5-based applications.  The second, layout 1, has provided better
parallel IO throughput on some systems.  Layout 1 is readable by other
HDF5-based applications but may require additional logic to extract the
full three dimensional data in, for example, visualization applications.
Future layout numbers will be monotonically increasing and stable across
ESIO versions.

Users are advised to choose a non-default layout only after having
benchmarked the available layouts and determined that performance gains
offset usability and data longevity.  At such a time, applications
can be retrofit to use a higher performance layout simply by adding an
esio_layout_set() call immediately after esio_handle_initialize().  All legacy
fields will continue to work alongside any new fields.
