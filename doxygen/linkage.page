/*! \page linkage Linking applications

<b>FIXME: Update linkage information</b>
<b>FIXME: Add pkg-config information</b>

To link an external C/C++ or Fortran application with the library, the
\c include directory must be added to the compilers include search
path in order to access the grvy.h header file (or for Fortran, the \c
lib directory should be added to access the pre-compiled
grvy F90 module).  The \c lib directory should also be added
to the linker search path along with a request to link against the
libGRVY library.  Several example link steps are provided below.  These
examples assume that the libGRVY library has been successfully built and
installed previously in the users's ~/bin/grvy directory:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode

<h3>Fortran Example</h3>

\code > $(FC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/lib app.f90 -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode

To embed the dynamic library search path for the libGRVY library
directly into the application executable, use an additional linker
option as follows:

<h3>C/C++ Example</h3>

\code > $(CC) -I$HOME/bin/grvy/include app.c -L$HOME/bin/grvy/lib \
         -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/bin/grvy/lib -lgrvy \endcode


<b>Important Note:</b> F90 module file formats are not consistent
across multiple compilers. Therefore, a Fortran application and the libGRVY
F90 interface \em must be built with the same Fortran compiler family to ensure
compatibility.
