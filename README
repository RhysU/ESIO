                                The ESIO Library
                                  Release 0.0.1

Overview

   The ExaScale IO (ESIO) library provides simple, high throughput
   input and output of structured data sets using parallel HDF5. ESIO is
   designed to support reading and writing turbulence simulation restart
   files but it may be useful in other contexts. The library is written
   in C99 and may be used by C89+ or C++ applications. A Fortran API
   built atop the F2003 standard ISO_C_BINDING is also available.

   The ESIO library provides:

     * Distributed IO of 1D lines, 2D planes, and 3D fields of data
     * Support for scalar-, complex-, and vector-valued data
     * Single and double precision floating point storage
     * A mechanism for storing both string and numeric metadata
     * Support for contiguous and strided in-memory data
     * Support to simplify writing restart file sequences
     * Storage within the widely used HDF5 file format

   The library's manual can be generated using Doxygen via the 'make docs'
   target.  The manual contains full details on the following topics:

     * Installation
     * Linking applications
     * Basic concepts
     * C/C++ API
     * C/C++ error handling API
     * Fortran API
     * Restart files
     * Benchmarking
     * Buildbot test coverage

   Brief licensing information, installation instructions, notable
   changes, and authorship details can be found in COPYING, INSTALL,
   NEWS, and AUTHORS respectively.

   Thank you for your interest in ESIO.

Reporting Bugs

   Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can
   be reported to Rhys Ulerich <rhys@ices.utexas.edu>. Requests and
   contributions are welcome at the same e-mail address. All bug reports
   should include:

     * the version number of the ESIO library,
     * the hardware and operating system,
     * the local compiler version number,
     * a description of the bug behavior, and ideally,
     * a short program which reproduces the bug.
